# meteor-spectrum-calibration with synthetic spectra
Analysis of meteor spectra with windows GUI.

New
Creation of synthetic spectra of typical meteor elements such as Fe, Mg, Na, Ca etc. plus atomic O and N of atmospheric origin as well as molecular nitrogen has been added. The intensities of the lines, spectral width and an additional continuum radiation and plasma temperature can be fitted by a Levenberg-Marquardt least square fit. Before fit:

after fit:

Also with calculation and application of instrument response function and correction of atmospheric extinction. In addition, the creation and use of a flat field for quantitative analysis of meteor spectra has been added as well.

The previous calibration of camera, lens and grating combination has been included in the script. Therefore only a single GUI allows this calibration and the subsequent processing of meteor spectra. For details of the calibration, see:

After the sucessful instrument calibration, the processing of meteor spectra can be done easily. It starts with a video file containing a meteor spectrum. The video is converted to video frames. A background image is computed and subtracted from the meteor images. Meteor images are transformed to orthographic projection in order to linearize spectra. These spectra are registered and added. After correcting tilt and slant the 2-D spectra are converted to 1-D spectra by adding rows. These raw spectra are calibrated using known meteor lines for calibration. The result can be plotted.

For a description of the processing see: https://meteorspectroscopy.org/2020/03/27/meteor-spectra-analysis-new-version/
or the manual in the doc folder.

For a description on the Instrument response (theory and application) see the response manual in the doc folder: 
https://github.com/meteorspectroscopy/meteor-spectrum-calibration/blob/response/doc/instrument%20response.pdf

In this manual is also described the correction of atmospheric extinction to the response function and the meteor spectra.
